# ShopScraper

This tool is a price tracker. It'll allow you to have a promotional follow-up on your favorite items of the websites:

- Snipes
- Zalando

When one of your items goes on promotion, you will be notified by email.

Steps of use:

- Compile in the file 'articles_urls.py' urls of the articles that interest you the most
- To receive the notification you'll have to specify the e-mail address of the sender and the e-mail address of the receiver in the file 'PriceTracker.py'
- Finally, you just have to execute the file 'PriceTracker.py'

PS: If you want to generate a csv table with some information related to your items, then execute the file 'articles_into_csv_file.py'.
